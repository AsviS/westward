## Server

This directory contain most of the files used by the server (the remaining ones being in the `/shared` folder). Most of
these files are used by being imported the main server-side file, `GameServer.js` (see explanation in [codebase structure](https://github.com/Jerenaux/westward/wiki/Structure-of-the-codebase)
wiki page.)

All these files are bundled by webpack into `dist/server.js`.

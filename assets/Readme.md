## Assets

This directory contains all the static assets used by the game client-side. Most directory names are self-explanatory, except perhaps:
- `/data` contains JSON files that define all the entities of the game (the different animal types, items, buildings, etc) as well
as tutorial steps and other texts 
- `/html` contains whatever HTML pages need to be loaded as game objects in the game, which is a functionality used to make
the tooltip for example 
- `/images` contains pictures currently or formerly used for the very basic game "editor" (in `/editor`, but it is more a map visualizer
than an actual editor at  the moment). The pictures used in the game itself are located in `/sprites` and  `/tilesets`
- `/misc` contains miscellaneous content, e.g. a list of swear words to prohibit in usernames
- `/wiki` contains the pictures used in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jerenaux/westward/wiki) pages

    "name": "Explorer",
    "desc": "The Path of Discovery. Explorers can travel longer distances than anyone and avoid battles more easily to find rare resources only available in remote locations - or to discover these locations in the first place. In addition, their experience with nature makes them more apt to gather crafting materials from dead animals and plants. This gives them important functions as scouts and providers of useful elements."

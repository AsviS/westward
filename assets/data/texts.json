Some say that these plains are like a wild animal who refuses to be tamed. But if you and other brave settlers like you play their part, I’m sure we will eventually succeed.",
    "Here are a few recommendations. You won’t make a name for yourself alone. You won’t achieve much unless your settlement thrives. Collaborate with the other settlers to increase its resources and expand its territory. Try to bring back food every day, at least as much as what you eat. And follow the directions of the Governor and the Chancellors. Hell, if you do well and get noticed by your fellow settlers, you may even become Governor yourself one day!",
    "But most of all, be careful when venturing out. As you may know, we are not alone in this land. And its inhabitants have only one wish, to throw us back in the sea. As if the dangerous wildlife was not enough. It’s only a matter of time before one of the settlements is attacked. When that day comes, you will all need to be ready. Help build towers, scout ahead for enemy positions, craft or import weapons to arm everyone. Do whatever you can, but do it fast, as the sightings of hostiles are becoming more frequent.",
    "In my opinion, there is of course only one true way to defend ourselves. We need to attack first. I’m petitioning the Governor of [OTSETL] to mount an offensive. I hope your governor and his Commanders can be more receptive, before it’s too late.",

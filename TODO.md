Misc:
- Split trees in two images with different depths
- Adapt animations and delays for firearms
- findcell in battle doesn't take path to get there into accoung (may be within radius but require to go around an obstacle!)
- Change battle priority when player joins fight
- In battle against NPC, have players have turns much more often
- Make tiles above battle tiles transparent; same with buildings in fight?
- Make arrows in bulk?
- Feather tufts
- Introduce new wood ingredient obtained from timber, crafting wood, made in bulk (but then tune down timber prod)
-> For shield, guns...?
- Clicks close to minimap fail
- Display/hide/display map leads to warnings overflow
- Still slow (make bick grass background on a blitter?)
- Items spawn on top of each other
- Slow Fort? Make rendertextures out of longslots?
- Spawning in battle area, moving: doesn't stop movement
- Stop walk when opening menu
- Camera bounds (test with northernmost camp)
- Minimap cross stop moving below a certain y?
- Northernmost camp not really visible on map
- Poll at regular interval the sprite below mouse
-> Need to display hunger and fatigue
-> Keep class quests (+ "smart quests" based on settlement situation?)
-> Menu to list buildings (but on-site management)

Consider spine for anims? (reread https://madmimi.com/p/81a31d?fe=1&pact=891641-147784135-9405065146-92563bf2497e7a654b4f394f405f098bd9e6e40a)

World building: move away from tiles:
[x] Zoom
[x] Panning
[x] 96x96 grass chunks, loaded positionnally
[x] Tiles only for other terrain elements (water, dirt, ...)
[x] Everything on top are single-image objects (possibly rendered in multiple parts with different depths)
[x] Test trees overlaps
[x] Sparse format, declarative (grass, water, ...)
[x] Specific tiles (e.g. water joints) computed positionnally
[x] Default filler tile for empty ones, on layer 0
[x] Store tilesets and images as atlases
[x] World maker: store coasts
[ ] Inexistant chunks filled by water
[ ] Add decor elements via editor
[ ] Store and edit game data (resources, spawn zones, civs logic...)
[x] Visualize collisions
[x] Collisions listed from tileset
[x] Collisions digest for server, displayed in editor
[x] Collisions fetched from tileset for client, no digest 
[ ] Built-in exploration, to test collisions and depths
[ ] Re-enable blitters, at least for ground and water?
[ ] Remove legacy tiles after a while (from png and json) + old tileset files


Shop & workshop interfaces
Quid feathers spawn?
Minimap w/ buildings + settlement screen map
Fog of war
Check building limits are enforced
Make big rock formations


##Tutorial:##
First few words about permanent sandbox, collaborative survival, etc.

Part 1: buildings
- Just arrived, need to settle
- A few buildings present, and towers, safe zone
- Point out useful buildings (workshop, brewery) are under construction buy other players, but need wood; 
prompt to go build a lumbercamp at the proper location (building tut + auto resources tut, depletion...)
- Explain that with that building, you can benefit other players, and their progress will benefit you in turn (access to crafting)
- Insist that buildings are permanent and that everyone can see and interact with everyone else's buildings

Part 2: exploration, crafting, trade and wildlife
- Prompt to go craft potion, point out that a specific ingredient is missing
- Prompt to go explore fog of war in a certain area (explain fog of war) + map tuto
- On the way, attack by wildlife, battle tuto
- food tuto (mention use for boosting production as well)
- When resource found, tuto about pick up resources and ecology
- Go back, sell and craft (trade & craft tuto)
- Talk about fatigue + prompt to build a shack

Part 3: enemy civ
- Point out that lumber camp is exposed, need to build a tower
- Immeditaley following, civs attack, explain geopolitical climate
- Tougher fight, better equipment will be needed!

Closing comments about pros and cons of starting in a settled/wild region, ultimate goal of surviving by pushing enemy civ back,

Admin
-----
List buildings, players
Make cmd line system
Edit buildings stock
Push desktop notifications for player connects
Import db
-> Iterate over import object, if matching id in db, update fields, if not, insert new entry 
Set coordinates
Maintenance mode
Secure

Analytics:
---------
- Log: tutorial begins, progress (each step) and ends, item pick ups/loot, menu opens?, fights (+ print types), kills
- Button to flush events
- Bundle events from one player into sessions
- Log session-wide stats: duration, how many players visit a building during session, do this, do that...
- Push desktop notifications for player connects
- Look for nice statistical library
- Log drains and faucets
- Log where items are bought/sold
- Log pathfinding destinations, consider making heatmap in the long term
- Log as many things as possible: session duration, distance travelled per session, time spent in settlement per session, in nature per session,
interactions with buildings, time spent in each individual menu, etc.
- Cluster "heavy" players vs "small-time" players and look for differences between the two
- Analyze sessions of one-time players who never come back
- Find other meaningful clusters (maybe in unsupervized fashion)
- Compare behaviors to how you expect the game to be played

Cleaning:
--------
Performance:
- Concile the two coexisting menu update systems: the one used by updateSelf and the one used by updateBuilding
-> All menus have an update() method called on display; upon new server data, only update() the current menu
-> DOn't call all updates on display; update when receiving server data, and that's it
- Rethink the calling of all events on menu open

- Make audio sprite
- Remove unnecessary files
- Use pool for notifications
- Avoid duplicate pins in maps, danger pins etc.
- Fix "already existing/non-existing" bugs
- Pathmaking instead of pahfinding?
- Dont send full building inventories when buying/selling (send arrays of deltas)
- Look into gzipping maps
Order:
- Display sprites in text: http://sbcgames.io/add-sprites-into-font-as-characters/
- Auto pack tileset.png
- Clean all tutorial stuff
- Store buildings data in separate files for the rendering stuff and the economic stuff;
-> At least for economuc stuff, do it in json5
- Send a digested config file from server to client
-> Include JSON files (items, animals...); allows to
--> Hide content
--> Send only useful fields
--> Move to JSON5 
- Look up and put as many parameters as possible in conf
- Integrate battle.processAttack & battle.processAoE?
- Proper initial cursor (using continuous polling or sth?)
- Central shared list of entities
- Remove global engine hover/out events, use local ones in animals, buildings...
- From 10.0: use pointer.worldX and worldY to handle location clicks
- Deal differently with net updates when visibility lost (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)
- Use containers
- Clean schemas
- Use data registry for data exchange between scenes (see Phaser World 119)
- Client-side, GameObject use tx and ty while Moving use tileX and tileY (and they both have a setPosition method)
=> fix in processItemClick, etc, test a lot
- Move UI stuff from Engine to UI
- Rework longslot system
- Setters/getters everywhere
- Centralize all texts (incl. stats, equip, and even item descriptions)
- Remove the shop-specific code from enterBuilding (use onEnter event if need be, manage inventory filters properly)
- Remove "longslot" stuff intended for stretching longslots vertically?
- Find out how to generate graphics objects (grid tiles, gradients...) programmatically for various uses
- Give toString method to custom objects to replace [this.constructor.name this.id] ...

Content:
-------
* Ambiance
- Use all the AoE2 sounds
- From : https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/whtdragons-animals-and-running-horses-now-with-more-dragons.53552/
-> Add seagulls, birds, frogs, small mammals, fishes (tinted), ...
-> Have fun with unicorn
- Carcasses, traces of fight, craters
- Paths along most-travelled paths
- Location sfx for each building
- Maximum ambient noises
-> Multiple categories (weather, animals, terrain...), distinct random intervals
* Battle system
- Bombs:
-> Stats??
-> Greater effect against buildings
-> Sound effect
-> Throw animation?
-> Variable damage based on bomb type
-> Factor defense in
- traps, poisons, potions, oils...
- burn effects inflicted by (crimson?) explosives
(-> trap bonuses to explorers? Natural crafting recipe to them?)
- Increase fatigue when fighting
- Effect of fatigue on fighting
( - Camera follows active figher? Could be more dynamic ; possibly with deadzone to avoid twitch)
- Gunpowder mechanics; remove it from bullet recipe?)
(- New interface:
Timer at bottom, icon of active fighter on the left, queue of others on the right
Skip turn below
Health and fatigue above, numerically + battle counters (movement, actions...)
Belt slots above + ammo slots + active weapon (ranged vs melee)
=> Allow both melee & ranged equipped at same type, ranged active by default)
(- Compute probability of items breaking and discard them)
(- Identify characters in the way of ranged attacks)
(- Anti-friendly fire safety for bombs)
(- Display health of enemies somehow)
(- Let NPC use items (restore health, ...))
(- 3-way battles)
* Civics
- Civic abilities
- Elections
- Naming officials
(- variable civic xp when committing, based on factors
- Taxes
- Change settlement
- Update population based on players (requires permanent players)
- Server side: check that not committing twice to same building)
* Character panel
-> Indicate starvation level of settlement
- restore "setClass" to use to compute different XP gains per class
- Adjust XP gains per class
- Display health, fatigue and gold permanently in HUD
- Remove % stats panel
- Redisplay committment slots
- Ability points

- Mystery potion that uses all plants in game, as a challenge
- Lock some recipes based on dev level
-> keep locked recipes but disable them (indicate why)
(
- XP based on multiple factors
Backpacks, gold pouches of various sizes...)
(- Recipes for golden ore -> gold ingots -> currency)
(- Tiers)
(- Upgrades)
(- Naming)
(- Dismantling)
(- Distinct interfaces for forging & brewing?
-> Furnace mechanics? (Duration and temperature, coald and/or wood as fuel...)
-> Brewing mechanics? (Brew duration, fuel as well...))
(- Add dosage mechanic when brewing) 
(- Full list of items)
* Explorer gameplay
- Map mechanics:
- Buggy building centering in fort?
-> Zoom:
--> Fix zoom-out out of map bounds
--> Zoom in/out with scroll 
--> Decide what level of zoom for Fort and Minimap
-> Data sync:
--> Iterate over markers of one map, if not in second map, add them
--> Each player memorizes own markers (when building is displayed in surrounding AOIs), reset when visitting fort
--> Danger markers automatically added to map when player dies
--> Destoyed building: automatically deletes marker in corresponding fort
--> Sync when visitting fort
--> Fort sync first: absorb markers from player, reset player
--> Player sync: copy fort markers
-> Fog of war:
--> Map instance stores list of AOIs together with timestamp
--> Player memorizes visitted AOIs
--> Two-way sync when visitting fort
--> Mini-masks per AOI, only applied if timestamp smaller than x
--> Work-out nice geometry
-> Clusters:
--> Split both zoom-level into chunks
--> Map all AOIs and markers to world map chunks
--> download only the relevant chunks, on the fly
-> Minimap: circular mask, no zoom buttons, no drag/drag following player, no fog of war
-> Future: custom markers, not synced
-> Future: markes about animal and plant populations, synced with fort, can be enabled/disabled on map
- Quests
- Civic XP when synchronizing enemy camps
- Less XP based on lvl (up to 0 XP around settlements past a certain level)
- Bonuses
- Show plant markers based on ability
* Enemy civ
// Lookup "tribal concept art" for inspiration on civs look
//: one single building type that spawns civs at regular intervals + map icons
-> Sprinkle several camps around settlements
- Inclusion of buildings in fights
- Targetting of buildings by civs
- Processing of attacks, destruction
- Settlement attack behavior (what time intervals, how many...)
- Allow players to attack buildings
- Tower behavior
- Auto-repair (for both settlers and civs), link to commitment
(- Wander behavior (squad), patrols
- Territory zones: if player step in, send small squad to track
- Name generator
- Camp economy
- Civs loot equipment and equip it
- Civs gain XP, level-up, become stronger (increase associated xp reward accordingly)
- Reflect that in hover card
- Test NPC vs animals)
* Help
- Review existing help buttons
- Add missing help buttons (including on specific lines to describe fatigue, food surplus...)
- Make tutorial quests (commitment & civic xp, battle, crafting...)
- Pop-up boxes describing things first time (first time in fort, workshop, character menu...)
* Inventory
- Click window: display stat effects
- Belt mechanics (quick-use slots for potions, bombs and weapons)
- Backpack mechanics, money pouches, ...
- Gunpowder mechanics (multiple pouches?)
- Dropping items
* Merchant gameplay
- Shops
- Caravans
- Homeland trade
- Inns
- Quests
- Bonuses
- Tax evasion
- Less XP based on level
* Misc
- Fatigue 
-> Accumulate it with actions, server-side ("stamina"): walking, committing, crafting, ...
-> Relate to food surplus
-> Display in character panel
-> Impact on actions
- Rest
- Campfires (+ leftovers + orientation pin + long distance smoke pins)
- Fix continuous movement system
- New camera system? ("dead zone")
=> Try new Phaser 3.11 deadzone first 
https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ItayKeren/20150511/243083/Scroll_Back_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Cameras_in_SideScrollers.php
-> Doesn't follow in central rect window, only follows when getting out of it and until player stops
( allows for small position adjustments)
or
-> Doesn't follow (except in battle)
-> Only follow when click destination is in screen margins (define margins size)
-> Space to interrupt movement?
or
-> Moves when cursor on sides (refresh pins), to some extent
-> Also moves using keystrokes; space to center
- Respawn losses?
- Messaging
- Leaderboards
- View info on other players (levels...)
- Guilds
* Orientations
- Pins for gunshots and explosions (requires special networking for long-distance sounds)
-> Much slower noise variation according to distance (since heard from very far)
-> Pin disappears after a few seconds
- Pins for alarm bells (same)
* Packaging
- Display nb connected
- Cheat-proof: proper auth system, lock admin
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-handle-authentication-with-node-using-passport-js-4a56ed18e81e
https://w3layouts.com/validate-login-register-forms-flat-responsive-widget-template/
- Automate standalone app build (as part of deployment)
* Settlement defense
- Enable commander to build towers
- Buildings health
- Show updated health in fort
- Set up stats of towers and forts
- Towers behave as animals and trigger fights (same battle behavior)
- Manage arrows stock? Need for arrow economy? Ammo economy?
- Same with forts
- Enable commander to build barracks
- Production of NPC troops
- Set up stats of troops
- Make troops engage enemies
- Troops control: no grouping with players, but list of orders to dispatch
-> Orders: go guard location x, patrol at location x
-> NPC will deploy appropriate move behavior accordingly and aggro any enemies automatically
(+ add in check for aggro code, detection of neighboring battle cells, so it intervenes in ongoing fights too)
-> Map-based interface in the fort, on the left list of troops (with randomly generated names),
select them, select order, and select location
-> NPC lvl-up like players, full soldier mode, improve battle abilities (can be checked in menu)
-> "training mode", costs money and food, make soldier unavailable, comes back lvled-up (higher level, higher cost)
-> Each has own equipment; resource flow to barracks, all items stored there can freely be assigned
to soldiers 
-> For training and change of equipment, soldier need to be at barracks to make changes ("come back" order)
- Maintaining troops consumes food as well (more than players? Less?)
* Settlement economy
Stop sending commit slots repeatedly
Hide commit button when already committed
Implement and test decommitment from db data
Modify update commit code to accomodate for commitment of > 1 turn
Have hunter huts produce pelts (good for leather economy)
Recipe: paper cartridges (paper also for bombs?)?
Make recipes (randomly?) for 5 consumables (potion, antidote, steady stuff...) + create ingredients
Recipes for fancy bullets and bombs
- Resource flow from all resource buildings to trade post
- Gold flow from tarde post to fort
- Fork trade post gold flow to fork and workshop
- Set reward of recipes for settlement (0 = disabled)
- Make spawn zones for plants/shrooms/etc.
- Dev levels
- Impact of dev level on exploration XP reward
- Let chancellor set prices in trade post
- Trade with overseas
- Salaries for officials, taxes
- Allow creation of new buildings (fixed locations to begin with)
- Lists of items rewarded by civic xp
* Soldier gameplay
- New compute battle destination in server/NPC?
- Battle cursors use new "next to" logic
- Monster variety & more spawn zones
- Abilities
- Quests
(- Whole ecology, variants of animals along north/south axis,
-> Brown wolves south, black ones south more powerful, same with gray and white wolves north
+ unicorn
- Rare/strong foes)
(- Advanced XP)

Deployment:
----------
- Tool to sync client buildings with server buildings
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files 
- Full CI pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)
- Desktop app (automated)

Testing:
-------
- https://hackernoon.com/testing-node-js-in-2018-10a04dd77391
- Mocha + Chai :https://hackernoon.com/a-crash-course-on-testing-with-node-js-6c7428d3da02
- Sinon: https://www.sitepoint.com/sinon-tutorial-javascript-testing-mocks-spies-stubs/
- https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/best-practices-for-spies-stubs-and-mocks-in-sinon-js
- Use Jasmine for client-side tests? Selenium for visual ones?
- Make lists of bugs happening and think about tests to make to catch them, at the finest granularity possible
- Tests on inventory manipulations, proper display of stats in items (w.r.t names used in Stats)
- Entering and re-entering workshop
- Add security tests that check config values, tutorial start, nothing in "on initialize" ...
- Test the connexion of an old player to see if it crashes or not; build sth, start a fight, etc.
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

World building:
--------------
1/ World creation:
- Add missing lakes 

2/ Cartography
- Has to come from actual in-game world
- Capture whole game map, with trees and all terrain elements
- Do so at arbitrary zoom levels
(- split in chunks)
- Apply post-processing effects to make it look nice

3/ World editor
-> Need to visualize game world at different zoom levels
-> Display and modify buildings
-> Display and modify spawnzones
-> Manage trees?
-> Integrate with admin to display and modify settlement data (+ events etc.) 

5/Building editor (visually define shape, collisons, etc.)
--
Custom chunk/world editor:
- Arrows on the fringes of the window allow to move quickly to adjacent chunks
- See borders of adjacent chunks to match fringe tiles
- Preserve whatever extra info is in the JSON file (vs Tiled who rewrites it)
- Versioning of individual chunks (saved in separate folder), for unlimited undos
- Add random elements (w/ scripts to remove them):
Building editor (set shapes etc.)
Manage spawn zones in editor
Flip trees horizontally to introduce variety
-> Patches of dirt
-> Tree decorations: flowers, stones, bushes
- Add cliffs in empty areas
-> Add random decorations to cliffs (stones in bends, ...)
- Compute tree density and spread random trees around accordingly?
- No tree if busy 3cells to the left? Or when planing tree, log width cells to right as no-go position
- Fix loops (lakes ...)
- Plan for more layers in dev
- Store forests and trees separately (trees.json) during dev?
-> During flattening, read that file and draw trees tile by tile
-> Test high-layers after flattening


UI:
---
- 8-directional characters, + attack (ranged & melee), object, die animations ...
- Movement target indicator
- Better battle tiles
- Battle UI
- Crafting/Workshop UI
- Better orientation pins (w/ way to indicate if in-fight)
- Better new player screens (class selection, settlement selection...)
- Abilities screen, civic screen...
- Landscape, trees, ...
- Animals (w/ animations)

- Logo 





Part I: Mechanics
Part II: World building
Part III: Atmosphere & polish
Part IV: Cleaning, optimization and admin

Pillars:
1) The War
2) The Economy
3) The Wild


Chapter 1
1) The War
- Too little building damage from civs
----
2) The Economy
- No repair?
- It's much easier to craft a gun than arrows and string-based stuff!
- Add sulfur mines
- Problem with food consumption?
- Tune down ores production a bit? 

---
- Rethink "per cycle" display in prod panel
- Introduce new wood ingredient obtained from timber, crafting wood, made in bulk (but then tune down timber prod)
-> For shield, guns...?
- Currency? (+ flow from trade post and workshop to fort) / money flow
- Fix the right amount of buildings in each settlement, their output per turn, turn duration
-> Simulate?
- Tune economy
- Starvation (impact) (think of ways to make it painfully visible)
- Settlement-oriented HUD: see below
-> Adapt positioning of orienation pins
- Compass
- Bell when attack
- Missions menu
(-> Eventually: missions, quests & achievements)
(-> Missions: bring food, defend, commit, follow chancellor directives,
defend trade routes, scout, maintain supplies)
(-> Control quests distribution?)
- Commitment lasts multiple turns; fix repeat send of commit slots
3) The Wild
=> Update texts
=> Test with someone

Chapter 2
1) The War
- New "building damage" stat (allows introducing specialized weapons: maces, ...)
=> Ranged weapon have very low building damage, melee weapon more, maces and axes much more, bombs a lot
- Multiple bomb types with variable stats
- Barracks and troops (need food inflow to barracks)
-> Troops need food to train + count for recurring food consumption
- Fortified civ camps, rebuilds
- More involved raid mechanics (patrols, list of units ready to raid, units coming back to base, units healing when at base) using a more complex states scheme
- NPC use ranged attacks (no firarms and bombs though)
2) The Economy 
(automatic economy)
- More advanced simulations to balance resources
- Permanent, named players
- Dev. levels
- Impact on crafting, buildings, ...
- New buildings, settlements expansion
- Homeland trade (automatic)
- Cash crops
- Economy orientation by chancellors
- Backpacks, purses, belts, gloves (remove shields) ...
- War economy (tower ammunitions, ...)
3) The Wild
- New World 
- Fog of war (timed)
-> Display a square on the map
-> Display visibleAOIs on fort map -> convex hull?
-> Have visibleAOIs set depend on buildings, esp. towers
-> Synchronize player.visittedAOIs to fort
-> Own fog of wars for players, update own map as they wander, synchronize when back to fort
- Icons synchronization
- Resources & misc map icons
- Trade routes (chancellors only), mark on maps
- Fatigue & rest, impact on everything
- Different pelts and leathers, rework crafting recipes, full pelt economy

Chapter 3:
1) The War
- Unit types & counters
- Advanced battle mechanics & UI (need belts first)
- Automated raids by commander, displayed to entice players
-> Force player battle pathfinding to fit in battle cells
-> Adapth pathfinding for multi-cell entities
-> trimPath for multicell entities
2) The Economy
- Pinning recipes on UI (so as not to have to memorize ingredients)
- Governor & officials
- Elections
- Taxes
- Citizenship changes
- Tuning of cash flows
- Manual homeland trade
3) The Wild
- Look into GameObject.willRender to see if can be used to know when a sprit is hidden by a tree, tower...

World building

###############
Prototype level:
###############

Cleaning:
--------
- Clean up json: those in maps should be arrays; those in data should have numeric keys
- Decide what to do with assets/maps folder, both for dev and prod
- Merge all the addXXX and removeXXX methods (but keepl separate lists) + merge addXXX loops in updateWorld()
- Clean up Utils
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Standardize the use of Utils methods for coordianes manipulations (gridtoline, linetogrid, tiletoiAOI, AOItotile, tileRelativeToAOI...)
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods
- Restructure UI, maybe remove UIElement, only have a set of generic functions to bind to interactive sprites?
- Think about a Container class or something to affect the transforms of all children, get rid of repeated finalize() calls
- Anchor panel elements at center, not top-left
- Clean all files
- Do not rely on constructor.name, instead use custom field (like the old "category")
- Add ES6 syntax to PHPStorm (for ... of)
- Optimize copy of collision map in GameServer.findPath

- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)


Testing:
-------
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

###############
Prototype level:
###############

- Think about typical gameplay scenarios and decide milestones accordingly
- Profiles: new vs old player, focused on self vs setllement, x 4 classes

Settlement-focused experience:
- Checks out settlement status in fort
-> Food surplus bonuses/maluses
-> Development goals + "next level"
-> Resource levels
-> Buildings status
-> Military threats
-> Map legend
-> Officials
-> Taxes
(-> Disable official prerogatives)
- Based on that, determine mission: bring in resource, combat threat, build...
- Lack of food: hunt and kill something
- Lack of gold: sell furs
- Other: go and commit to relevant buildings
- Commit to buildings being built, until completion
- Earn civic xp with commitment
- Gray out some actions based on civic level
- Show dev level impact in stats panel
- Show committment slots in char panel

Then:
- Make Westward page
- Have 2 settlements, with important differences 
- World map-based settlement selection menu (mention key aspects, display enemy civ threats)
- Class selection menu (describe impact on settlements)
- Help buttons *everywhere*
- Add short descriptions to items
- One-time single-panel combat tutorial when first combat
- One-time single-panel intro text when first login
- Orientation panel in char menu hinting at what to do and where to go (w/ map?)
Goal: 1h of gameplay?

Week:
Fort: next level requirements
Construction: handle commitment
Construction: earn civic xp on commit (and use real numbers in character)
Economic loop: impact of materials availability on building 
Economic loop: apply effect of food deficit on players (+ update character panel)
Economic loop: update buildings panel in real time (clever updates)
Economic loop: test all updates of all menus 
Character: display committed buildings
Character: add new stats
Battle: skin dead animals
Battle: display event pop-ups after skinning
Battle: multiplayer fights
Finish: review base stats values; test economy for a while


Cleaning:
--------
Performance:
- Dont send full building inventories when buying/selling (send arrays of deltas)
- Use pool for footsteps (see Groups, who now act as pools)
- Use pools for players, animals, ...
- Fix null values in left-fringe chunks (fixed?)
->nulls in corrupted chunks likely arise from "undefined" values being converted to null by JSON.stringify
-> Happens on the fringe -> because for these drawShore returns undefined?!
- listCollisions: don't store water tiles, only shore etc.
- Flattening: second pass to delete water-only chunks based on visibility
- Flattening based on transparency
- Store tiles of the shape of a building somewhere instead of recomputing (e.g. in canBuild) [May be obsolete if buildings have rect shapes in future]
- To check if update packets are empty: iterate over keys and check for emptyness using typeof (if array and length 0 ...)
Order:
- Remove unnecessary files (esp. sprites)
- Remove "longslot" stuff intended for stretching longslots vertically?
- Find out how to generate graphics objects (grid tiles, gradients...) programmatically for various uses
- Use events gameobject events for input + custom events for updating menus (https://phaser.io/phaser3/devlog/112)
- One clean, central way to manage tilesets, config variables, depth, blitters... (blitter selection in client/Chunk, "mawLayer" field in WorldEditor ...)
- Give toString method to custom objects to replace [this.constructor.name this.id] ...
- Decide what to do with assets/maps folder, both for dev and prod
- Merge all the addXXX and removeXXX methods (but keepl separate lists) + merge addXXX loops in updateWorld()
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods (and world-building methods from studio/Engine)
- Restructure UI, maybe remove UIElement, only have a set of generic functions to bind to interactive sprites?
- Anchor panel elements at center, not top-left
- Make chatbar panel a subclass of Panels? Wait to see if other panels don't need DOM elements

Analytics:
---------
- Use gameanalytics? http://phaser.io/tutorials/game-analytics
- Log as many things as possible: session duration, distance travelled per session, time spent in settlement per session, in nature per session,
interactions with buildings, time spent in each individual menu, etc.
- Cluster "heavy" players vs "small-time" players and look for differences between the two
- Analyze sessions of one-time players who never come back
- Find other meaningful clusters (maybe in unsupervized fashion)
- Compare behaviors to how you expect the game to be played

Deployment:
----------
- Flatten chunks and reduce them to arrays only
- Code to load flattened chunks in game
- Separate as much as possible the code required for production and the code required for testing
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files and move them to production directory
- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)

Testing:
-------
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

Tools:
------
Custom chunk editor:
- Arrows on the fringes of the window allow to move quickly to adjacent chunks
- See borders of adjacent chunks to match fringe tiles
- Preserve whatever extra info is in the JSON file (vs Tiled who rewrites it)
- Versioning of individual chunks (saved in separate folder), for unlimited undos


World building:
--------------
- Add random elements (w/ scripts to remove them):
-> Patches of dirt
-> Tree decorations: flowers, stones, bushes
- Add cliffs in empty areas
-> Add random decorations to cliffs (stones in bends, ...)
- Compute tree density and spread random trees around accordingly?
- No tree if busy 3cells to the left? Or when planing tree, log width cells to right as no-go position
- Fix loops (lakes ...)
- Plan for more layers in dev
- Store forests and trees separately (trees.json) during dev?
-> During flattening, read that file and draw trees tile by tile
-> Test high-layers after flattening

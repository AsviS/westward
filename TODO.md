-------
Trailer
Decide cycle (eco, spawn)
Make sure all menus have something interesting to show 
Test economy for a while
When forge, update equip advice to include crafting
Reread all tips and help

Make recipes for 5 items (sword, bullets, bombs...) + create ingredients
Make recipes (randomly?) for 5 consumables (potion, antidote, steady stuff...) + create ingredients
Recipes for fancy bullets and bombs
Add recipes for all intermediary ingredients
Workshop building, interface = usual crafting menu
Add shop interface as well
Display recipes with building and class restrictions
Scatter basic ingredients
Coal mine

Add all other mines (iron, sulfur, gold) + flows
Add wood and stone flow to trade post
Specific interface for workshop, with own stock and settlement stock + gold
-> 100% own stock or 100% city stock to begin with
-> If using city stock, created item also lands in city stock
Fork trade post gold flow to fork and workshop
Set reward of recipes for settlement (0 = disabled)
Golden ore flow from mine to workshop
Recipe for golden ore -> gold ingots
Recipe for gold ingots -> currency
Addition "fuel" field (wood)

Make spawn zones for plants/shrooms/etc.
Make separate brewing interface, similar but with adjustable dosage

Cleaning:
--------
Performance:
- Fix "already existing/non-existing" bugs
- Use Phaser tilemaps?
- Animals keep their target
- "Sleep" mode for NPC when no player in currentAOI.entities (change flags on AOI transition, not on every NPC update loop iteration)
- Pathmaking instead of pahfinding?
- Concile the two coexisting menu update systems: the one used by updateSelf and the one used by updateBuilding
-> All menus have an update() method called on display; upon new server data, only update() the current menu
- Dont send full building inventories when buying/selling (send arrays of deltas)
- Use pools for players, animals, ...
- Fix null values in left-fringe chunks (fixed?)
->nulls in corrupted chunks likely arise from "undefined" values being converted to null by JSON.stringify
-> Happens on the fringe -> because for these drawShore returns undefined?!
- listCollisions: don't store water tiles, only shore etc.
- Flattening: second pass to delete water-only chunks based on visibility
- Flattening based on transparency
- Store tiles of the shape of a building somewhere instead of recomputing (e.g. in canBuild) [May be obsolete if buildings have rect shapes in future]
Order:
- Settlements: after compute food surplus, one central method to broadcast it to buildings and players, using one
common "formatFoorSurplus" method to decide exact formatting (witg a reciprocal function client-side)
- Building update: somehow check for fields in data not in map, and make a warning?
- Remove quick fixes about setFrame (big buttons, ctrl+f on quick fix)
- Deduce food_id from database
- Use schemas for players
- "getName()" method to get items names rather than accessing dict
- Rework longslot system
- Rethink the calling of all events on menu open
- Setters/getters everywhere
- Remove Engine.updateInventory() (moved to Inventory)
- Clean orientation code based on tweens, not previous pos?
- Hero class, StatsManager, EquipmentManager (NetworkManager?)
- Clean up Building.update() and updateSelf()
- Centralize all texts (incl. stats, equip, and even item descriptions)
- Remove the shop-specific code from enterBuilding (use onEnter event if need be, manage inventory filters properly)
- Tie input events to game objects, rather than global functions (use topOnly)
- Remove unnecessary files (esp. sprites)
- Remove "longslot" stuff intended for stretching longslots vertically?
- Find out how to generate graphics objects (grid tiles, gradients...) programmatically for various uses
- Use events gameobject events for input + custom events for updating menus (https://phaser.io/phaser3/devlog/112)
- One clean, central way to manage tilesets, config variables, depth, blitters... (blitter selection in client/Chunk, "mawLayer" field in WorldEditor ...)
- Give toString method to custom objects to replace [this.constructor.name this.id] ...
- Decide what to do with assets/maps folder, both for dev and prod
- Merge all the addXXX and removeXXX methods (but keepl separate lists) + merge addXXX loops in updateWorld()
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods (and world-building methods from studio/Engine)

Analytics:
---------
- Use gameanalytics? http://phaser.io/tutorials/game-analytics
- Log as many things as possible: session duration, distance travelled per session, time spent in settlement per session, in nature per session,
interactions with buildings, time spent in each individual menu, etc.
- Cluster "heavy" players vs "small-time" players and look for differences between the two
- Analyze sessions of one-time players who never come back
- Find other meaningful clusters (maybe in unsupervized fashion)
- Compare behaviors to how you expect the game to be played

Deployment:
----------
- Flatten chunks and reduce them to arrays only
- Code to load flattened chunks in game
- Separate as much as possible the code required for production and the code required for testing
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files and move them to production directory
- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)

Testing:
-------
- Make public attributions to assets you used
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

Tools:
------
Custom chunk editor:
- Arrows on the fringes of the window allow to move quickly to adjacent chunks
- See borders of adjacent chunks to match fringe tiles
- Preserve whatever extra info is in the JSON file (vs Tiled who rewrites it)
- Versioning of individual chunks (saved in separate folder), for unlimited undos


World building:
--------------
- Add random elements (w/ scripts to remove them):
-> Patches of dirt
-> Tree decorations: flowers, stones, bushes
- Add cliffs in empty areas
-> Add random decorations to cliffs (stones in bends, ...)
- Compute tree density and spread random trees around accordingly?
- No tree if busy 3cells to the left? Or when planing tree, log width cells to right as no-go position
- Fix loops (lakes ...)
- Plan for more layers in dev
- Store forests and trees separately (trees.json) during dev?
-> During flattening, read that file and draw trees tile by tile
-> Test high-layers after flattening

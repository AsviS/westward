Import db
-> Iterate over import object, if matching id in db, update fields, if not, insert new entry 
Maintenance mode
Set gold
Set coordinates
Set settlement parameters
Secure

Analytics:
---------
- Implement custom analytics, save in db
- Look for nice statistical library
- Log drains and faucets
- Log as many things as possible: session duration, distance travelled per session, time spent in settlement per session, in nature per session,
interactions with buildings, time spent in each individual menu, etc.
- Cluster "heavy" players vs "small-time" players and look for differences between the two
- Analyze sessions of one-time players who never come back
- Find other meaningful clusters (maybe in unsupervized fashion)
- Compare behaviors to how you expect the game to be played

Cleaning:
--------
Performance:
- Use pool for notifications
- Avoid duplicate pins in maps, danger pins etc.
- Fix "already existing/non-existing" bugs
- "Sleep" mode for NPC when no player in currentAOI.entities (change flags on AOI transition, not on every NPC update loop iteration)
- Pathmaking instead of pahfinding?
- Concile the two coexisting menu update systems: the one used by updateSelf and the one used by updateBuilding
-> All menus have an update() method called on display; upon new server data, only update() the current menu
- Dont send full building inventories when buying/selling (send arrays of deltas)
- Fix null values in left-fringe chunks (fixed?)
->nulls in corrupted chunks likely arise from "undefined" values being converted to null by JSON.stringify
-> Happens on the fringe -> because for these drawShore returns undefined?!
- listCollisions: don't store water tiles, only shore etc.
- Flattening: second pass to delete water-only chunks based on visibility
- Flattening based on transparency
- Store tiles of the shape of a building somewhere instead of recomputing (e.g. in canBuild) [May be obsolete if buildings have rect shapes in future]
Order:
- Reimplement maps using containers
- Refactor building management, shapes, positioning... (from bottom-left)
- Use containers
- Clean schemas
- Use data registry for data exchange between scenes (see Phaser World 119)
- Client-side, GameObject use tx and ty while Moving use tileX and tileY (and they both have a setPosition method)
=> fix in processItemClick, etc, test a lot
- Clean scene transition code
- Move UI stuff from Engine to UI
- Building update: somehow check for fields in data not in map, and make a warning?
- Remove quick fixes about setFrame (big buttons, ctrl+f on quick fix)
- "getName()" method to get items names rather than accessing dict
- Rework longslot system
- Rethink the calling of all events on menu open
- Setters/getters everywhere
- Client-side, move common update elements of player and animal to new moving.update()
- StatsManager (NetworkManager?)
- Clean up Building.update() and updateSelf()
- Centralize all texts (incl. stats, equip, and even item descriptions)
- Remove the shop-specific code from enterBuilding (use onEnter event if need be, manage inventory filters properly)
- Remove unnecessary files (esp. sprites)
- Remove "longslot" stuff intended for stretching longslots vertically?
- Find out how to generate graphics objects (grid tiles, gradients...) programmatically for various uses
- One clean, central way to manage tilesets, config variables, depth, blitters... (blitter selection in client/Chunk, "mawLayer" field in WorldEditor ...)
- Give toString method to custom objects to replace [this.constructor.name this.id] ...
- Decide what to do with assets/maps folder, both for dev and prod
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods (and world-building methods from studio/Engine)

Content:
-------
* Ambiance
- Plants spawn in clusters
- Specific zones for all items, not random spread
- Footsteps to all creatures, sound effects (on actions + environment: birds, water, ...)
- Animal noises when beasts in proximity, animal footsteps, player footsteps noise
- Carcasses, traces of fight, traces of campfires
- Paths along most-travelled paths
* Battle system
- Walk towards enemy before triggering battle (to limit size of battle arena and center everything)
- Use custom pathfinder to find battle cell (fulfill condition is a function rather than a specific cell)
- Custom PF: don't cross cells occupied by other fighters
- Get arrows back when skinning
- Animals have sorted list of targets, iteratr through it when first one not reachable for some reason
-> Deal with big battlefields; focus camera on active player (problem: if far away, surrounding AOIs not displayed), ...
- Fighters queue indicating participants and upcoming turns
- Identify characters in the way of ranged attacks

- XP proportional to distance 
- Reset visitted AOIs when going to fort
- Reward only when checking in at fort? (more fun to get it on the go)
- Do not grant XP for inhabitted AOIs (keep track of them somehow)
- Map mechanics
-> Zoom:
--> Make another zoom-level tr map, which becomes default. The 005 ones becomes "zoom-out" mode
--> addButtons method to add zoom buttons at speicifc coordinates 
-> Data sync:
--> Iterate over markers of one map, if not in second map, add them
--> Each player memorizes own markers (when building is displayed in surrounding AOIs), reset when visitting fort
--> Danger markers automatically added to map when player dies
--> Destoyed building: automatically deletes marker in corresponding fort
--> Sync when visitting fort
--> Fort sync first: absorb markers from player, reset player
--> Player sync: copy fort markers
-> Fog of war:
--> Map instance stores list of AOIs together with timestamp
--> Player memorizes visitted AOIs
--> Two-way sync when visitting fort
--> Mini-masks per AOI, only applied if timestamp smaller than x
--> Work-out nice geometry
-> Clusters:
--> Split both zoom-level into chunks
--> Map all AOIs and markers to world map chunks
--> download only the relevant chunks, on the fly
-> Minimap: circular mask, no zoom buttons, no drag/drag following player, no fog of war
-> Future: custom markers, not synced
-> Future: markes about animal and plant populations, synced with fort, can be enabled/disabled on map

Deployment:
----------
- Flatten chunks and reduce them to arrays only
- Code to load flattened chunks in game
- Separate as much as possible the code required for production and the code required for testing
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files and move them to production directory
- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)
- Desktop app (automated)

Design document:
---------------
-> Market research
- Finish copying notes (currently: in ambiance, npc dialogues)
- Concile all texts (doc, crafting.txt)
- Decide list of buildings, items, ...
- Make Excel tables (crafting, inventory, bestiary, ...)
- Make powerpoint
- Make feature matrix
- Consequence graphs
- Tidy up (charts, tables, Latex formulas...)
- For v1 schedule: follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moW8-MXjivs priorization method from (36:00)

Polish:
------
Visual:
- More dramatic apparition of battle tiles
- Hide move marker (use different mouse cursors for can/can't walk to)
- "Tip of the day"
- Revamp class selection
- Fix continuous movement
- Polish title screen (leaves, bird passing in the distance...)
- Fade-in/out transitions (wait for containers?)
- Show "new" tag when opening inventory
- Cut corners of big battlezones? (but make sure it doesn't impact integrity: save integrity path and used it for that)
- Variety of small "talk" bubbles in reaction to things happening (+ symbol bubbles?)
- Adapt bubble duration (in bubble.display) depending on number of words
- Add dirt below buildings
- Animation when using item, throwing item, equipping... (reactive, before getting network response)
- Hover frame for closing cross
- Hover background for inventory tiles?
- Hower card over gold indicator
- When hovering equipment, highlight corresponding equip slot
- Use particle emitters for several cool effects, like cloud puffs, dust when walking, lights, etc.
- Light effect layer (https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-light-effects-in-phaser3)
- Add cloud silhouettes
- Custom movement marker
- Use matter.js to simulate wind on leaves? (Dead/alive leaves flying on screen)
Sound:
- Sound effects when clicking (for moving, on buttons in menus, sounds of shuffling pages...)
- Noise when walking
- Noise when clicking on building (each building its noise)
- Noise when clicking on non-walkable tile
- Unique noise for items
- Crafting SFX
General:

- Categories of items? (How to concile with various backpack sizes)? Sorting of items?
- Polish existing content
- Light effects
- HUD, title screen, animations ...
- Varied and nice landmarks to give life to the world and act as waypoints

Testing:
-------
- Make numeric simulations linking everything:
-> Time to acquire dev level goals based on building production rates, varying number of buildings, productivity, etc.
-> Evolution of food surplus based on number of players, buildings, etc.
-> Set all these paremeters in a virtual settlement, simulate one day/week/month/year buy iteratively computing all cycles and their consequences in that time, then see results
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

World building:
--------------
-> Custom pathfinding, World editor, manage spawn zones...
Custom pathfinding: remove quick fix from Animal.goToDestination()
Custom chunk editor:
- Arrows on the fringes of the window allow to move quickly to adjacent chunks
- See borders of adjacent chunks to match fringe tiles
- Preserve whatever extra info is in the JSON file (vs Tiled who rewrites it)
- Versioning of individual chunks (saved in separate folder), for unlimited undos
- Add random elements (w/ scripts to remove them):
Building editor (set shapes etc.)
-> Patches of dirt
-> Tree decorations: flowers, stones, bushes
- Add cliffs in empty areas
-> Add random decorations to cliffs (stones in bends, ...)
- Compute tree density and spread random trees around accordingly?
- No tree if busy 3cells to the left? Or when planing tree, log width cells to right as no-go position
- Fix loops (lakes ...)
- Plan for more layers in dev
- Store forests and trees separately (trees.json) during dev?
-> During flattening, read that file and draw trees tile by tile
-> Test high-layers after flattening

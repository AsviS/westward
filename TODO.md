World building

###############
Prototype level:

Cleaning:
--------
Performance:
- Investigate using blitters instead, for footsteps etc. (see https://phaser.io/phaser3/devlog/56)
-> Create 2x#tilesets blitters: for lower ground and for higher layers
- Use pool for footsteps (see Groups, who now act as pools)
- Store tiles of the shape of a building somewhere instead of recomputing (e.g. in canBuild) [May be obsolete if buildings have rect shapes in future]
Order:
- Give toString method to custom objects to replace [this.constructor.name this.id] ...
- Decide what to do with assets/maps folder, both for dev and prod
- Merge all the addXXX and removeXXX methods (but keepl separate lists) + merge addXXX loops in updateWorld()
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods (and world-building methods from studio/Engine)
- Restructure UI, maybe remove UIElement, only have a set of generic functions to bind to interactive sprites?
- Think about a Container class or something to affect the transforms of all children, get rid of repeated finalize() calls
=> Use container game object from Phaser
-> Store sprites in multiple arrays simultaneously; one common displayList, to toggle the visible state, and possibly other logical containers to adjust depth
-> Maybe position everything according to oirign
-> One manual call to finalize() at the end, if any; or auto when adding to menu (the menu calls it in addPanel)
- Anchor panel elements at center, not top-left
- Make chatbar panel a subclass of Panels? Wait to see if other panels don't need DOM elements
- Make subclass of Panels for stats, and maybe others

Design document:
---------------

- Make powerpoint
- Make feature matrix
- Consequence graphs
- Tidy up (charts, tables, Latex formulas...)
- For v1 schedule: follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moW8-MXjivs priorization method from (36:00)

Polish:
------
Visual:
- Find better font
- Menu sprites change size when hovered / clicked
- Hover cards over empty equipment slots
- Hover cards over craftring buttons
- Hower card over gold indicator
- Highlight buttons and buildings on hover
- Use particle emitters for several cool effects, like cloud puffs, dust, lights, etc.
- Light effect layer
- Add cloud silhouettes
- Custom movement marker
- Different footpritns for different animals
- Use matter.js to simulate wind on leaves? (Dead/alive leaves flying on screen)

- Noise when walking
- Noise when clicking on building (each building its noise)
- Noise when clicking on non-walkable tile

- Crafting SFX
General:
- Feedback for rejected paths because too long (question mark, sound, ...)
- Polish existing content
- Footsteps, light effects, sound effects (on actions + environment: birds, water, ...)
- HUD, title screen, animations ...
- Animal noises when beasts in proximity, animal footsteps, player footsteps noise
- Carcasses, traces of fight
- Fix panel tweens (positions not update often enough?)
- Varied and nice landmarks to give life to the world and act as waypoints

World building:
--------------
- Test flattening of trees
- listCollisions: don't store water tiles, only shore etc.
- Flattening: second pass to delet water-only chunks based on visibility
- Fix null values in left-fringe chunks
->nulls in corrupted chunks likely arise from "undefined" values being converted to null by JSON.stringify
-> Happens on the fringe -> because for these drawShore returns undefined?!
- Different tree distribution based on geographical sectors
-> Make weighted table based on distance to poles
-> Randomly pick tree type from table
-> 1/1000 chance of dead tree, regardless of type
- Compute tree density and spread random trees around accordingly
- Add random elements
- Investigate the possibility of making cliffs from terrain data of the east coast
- Rework cliffs
- Fix loops (lakes ...)
- Plan for more layers in dev
- Store forests and trees separately (trees.json) during dev?
-> During flattening, read that file and draw trees tile by tile
-> Test high-layers after flattening

Analytics:
---------
- Use gameanalytics? http://phaser.io/tutorials/game-analytics
- Log as many things as possible: session duration, distance travelled per session, time spent in settlement per session, in nature per session,
interactions with buildings, time spent in each individual menu, etc.
- Cluster "heavy" players vs "small-time" players and look for differences between the two
- Analyze sessions of one-time players who never come back
- Find other meaningful clusters (maybe in unsupervized fashion)
- Compare behaviors to how you expect the game to be played

Deployment:
----------
- Flatten chunks and reduce them to arrays only
- Code to load flattened chunks in game
- Separate as much as possible the code required for production and the code required for testing
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files and move them to production directory
- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)

Testing:
-------
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.

Tools:
------
Custom chunk editor:
- Arrows on the fringes of the window allow to move quickly to adjacent chunks
- See borders of adjacent chunks to match fringe tiles
- Preserve whatever extra info is in the JSON file (vs Tiled who rewrites it)
- Versioning of individual chunks (saved in separate folder), for unlimited undos

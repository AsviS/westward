World building

###############
Prototype level:
###############

Cleaning:
--------
- Create World object, may or may not replace Gaia, to store info about world (dimensions, busy tiles...) and world-building methods
-> Move it t studio
- Handle 404 errors when chunk file not found
- Clean up Utils
- Write Readme detailling structure of code: assets, client/server/shared code (-> for production), tools (command-line scripts) and studio
- Move Geometry to studio
- Replace delete calls in updatePkg.clean() by something else
- Split server in two (game and dev server)
- Order files in studio
- Standardize the use of Utils methods for coordianes manipulations (gridtoline, lientogrid, tiletoiAOI, AOItotile, tileRelativeToAOI...)
- Sort-out shardness issues of Utils, and the need to have common properties such as tileWidth etc. readily available both in dev and prod
- Remove unnecessary map directories/files and assets
- Remove unnecessary Geometry methods
- Restructure UI, maybe remove UIElement, only have a set of generic functions to bind to interactive sprites?
- Think about a Container class or something to affect the transforms of all children
- Clean all files

- Make Excel tables (inventory, bestiary, ...)
- Make powerpoint
- Make feature matrix
- Consequence graphs
- Tidy up (charts, tables, Latex formulas...)
- For v1 schedule: follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moW8-MXjivs priorization method from (36:00)

World building:
--------------
- Try and make east coast with rivers and lakes
- Have a universal ChunkEdit class used accross all tools for all types of modifications
-> Or a ChunkHolder class which stores chunks in some way and only expose a addTile method which is used by the editor/geometry classes as a callback
-> Possibly the same chunk management both in live edit and with tools; remake the redo/switch function by getting rid
of the awkward temporary chunks, and instead, when editing, make a backup copy of affected chunks, and when redo/switch,
just restore it
- Fix saving tool
- Investigate the possibility of making cliffs from terrain data of the east coast
- Fix cliif outlines
- Add forests
- Add random elements

Deployment:
----------
- Flatten chunks and reduce them to arrays only
- Code to load flattened chunks in game
- Separate as much as possible the code required for production and the code required for testing
- Tool to gather, uglify and compress all relevant source files and move them to production directory
- Automate git upload to Heroku (http://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/)
- Full pipeline: flatten->gather->upload (flatten and gather not necessary for 100% of commits, so need to be able to select them with flags)
- Tool to automatically merge all graphic assets in atlases?
- Way to interact with Node server online, without restarting (e.g. change variables, reload data...)
- Improve flattening by making transparency checks
- Secure chunk access? (check client position before serving)


Testing:
-------
- Figure out testing:
- Have a test server, test database a test map set up
- Open browser and run test script in test world
- Manually run it before deployment
- Have the testing pipeline work with both development and production code (run it once, prodify, then check again, the upload)
- Optimize: remove divisions, benchmark runtimes, etc.
